# ICDAR 2023 Competition on Robust Layout Segmentation in Corporate Documents


Document layout segmentation is essential to achieve high-quality PDF document conversion. Previous document layout segmentation competitions have been held at ICDAR on popular datasets, such as PubLayNet, which is sourced from scientific literature only.

In this competition, we propose our newly published, human-annotated DocLayNet dataset as the base for a significantly more challenging competition on various documents from corporate, technical and law domains. DocLayNet is highly diverse in layout coverage, and includes Financial reports, Patents, Manuals, Laws, Tenders and Technical Papers. It is human-annotated with 11 distinct layout class labels. Additionally, it provides not only layout annotations, but also a JSON representation of original text tokens from the PDF code. As such, it opens the opportunity for new, multi-modal ML approaches to the layout segmentation problem.
